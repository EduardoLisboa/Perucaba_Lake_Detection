## Perucaba Lake Detection
Simple algorithm to detect the lake Perucaba and show an image of the detection.

Algorithm made using OpenCV, Numpy and Matplotlib in Python 3.7.6

I used the **findContours** and **drawContours** functions from OpenCV, which uses Numpy arrays for returning the contours. And matplotlib was used to plot the images on screen.

To run the code in the terminal:

```python perucaba.py```
